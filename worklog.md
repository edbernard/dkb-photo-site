DKB Photo Site
========================================

Current
----------------------------------------

Working on preview functionality

Remaining To Do
----------------------------------------

* Drag-n-drop in UI
* Create and use image thumbnails.
* Finish styling the pages.
* Add lightbox (microbox)
* Configuration for server/upload.

* Switch away from file-based metadata.
  Too many troubles with URL escaping.

* Sync with S3.

* Package for Dad:

  - Create wrapper bat files he can
    click on.

  - Remove dev-specific things.

  - Add step to build SCSS, other things
    that Dad shouldn't need to build to
    redeploy the site.
