DKB Photo Site
========================================


Remaining To Do
----------------------------------------

* Create and use image thumbnails.

* Switch away from file-based metadata.
  Too many troubles with URL escaping.

* Rsync-ish upload (diff and only upload
  new content. Check file hashes and
  rename files that have only changed
  names).

* Configuration for server/upload.
* Finish styling the pages.
* Add lightbox (microbox)

* Package for Dad:

  - Create wrapper bat files he can
    click on.

  - Remove dev-specific things.

  - Add step to build SCSS, other things
    that Dad shouldn't need to build to
    redeploy the site.
